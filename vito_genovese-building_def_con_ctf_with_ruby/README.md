# Building DEF CON CTF with Ruby

DEF CON Capture the Flag is the world series of computer hacking, with hundreds
of teams from all over the world trying to qualify, and a select few competing
on site in Las Vegas. For our first time hosting this event, we picked a
Ruby-based stack running the game, which has teams attempting to defend their
network services while hacking opponents' and stealing secrets. What's involved
in competing in DEF CON CTF? How did we build two complete competitions in five
months? What kind of teams survive the experience?

## Vito Genovese

Vito "Don Vito" Genovese is an Italian-born American mobster and crime boss who 
rose to power in America during the Castellammarese War to later become leader 
of the Genovese crime family. Genovese served as mentor to the future boss of 
the Genovese crime family Vincent "Chin" Gigante.

In 2013 Vito was a member of Legitimate Business Syndicate, the group that 
hosted and operated DEF CON Capture the Flag, and will be hosting again in
2014.
